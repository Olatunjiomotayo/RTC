# Analysis of Road Traffic Collisions in Cambridgeshire, United Kingdom,

## Project Overview

Road Traffic Collisions (RTC) poses a huge global menace in urban settings leading to damage of properties, injuries, tragic loss of life, and socio-economic consequences. This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of road accident data in Cambridgeshire focusing on the collision severity across different levels (slight, serious, and fatal), distributions, and statistical analysis to give insight into the contributing factors, the patterns and trends. The study addresses the need for robust Machine Learning (ML) algorithms for effective prediction of road traffic severity. The models, including Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) were built by analysing historical data gathered from Cambridgeshire insight data repository. The performance of the models was evaluated using recall, precision, and F1-score. The models established a strong performance with high accuracy. Random forest classier performed best with accuracy of 97%, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Gradient Boosting Machine came close with accuracy of 95% and 93% respectively. Support Vector Machine has accuracy of 92% while Logistic Regression has lowest accuracy of 88%.

This research is aimed to contribute to the growth of Cambridgeshire and the outcome will help several key stakeholders in making informed decisions and implementing practical measures to curb the occurrences and severity of road traffic accidents.

Key Stakeholders:

- Department for Transportation
- Local Traffic Management Authorities
- Road Safety Corps
- Cambridgeshire County Council
- Transportation Authorities
- Emergency Services Department
- Public Health Organisations
- Environmental Agencies
- Insurance Companies
- Public
- Media
- Local Businesses and Logistics Companies


## Data Source

This study used a dataset obtained from the Cambridgeshire Insight data repository. The dataset spans from January 1, 2017, to March 31, 2024, and consists of three sheets, each addresses different aspect of the collisions:

- Crashes: Provides a list of the collisions that took place.			
- Vehicles: Provides a list of all the vehicles that were involved in the collisions.	
- Casualties: Provides a list of all the casualties that occurred because of the collisions.
